This library is part of the https://www.rabbitmq.com/client-libraries/amqp-client-libraries[RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 client libraries].
It targets RabbitMQ 4.0 and requires at least Java 11 (Java 21 or more is recommended).

Please refer to the https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-amqp-java-client/stable/htmlsingle/[documentation] to find out more.

== Project Maturity

The project is in development and stabilization phase.
Features and API are subject to change, but https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-amqp-java-client/stable/htmlsingle/#stability-of-programming-interfaces[breaking changes] will be kept to a minimum.

== Versioning

The RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 Java Client is in development and stabilization phase.
When the stabilization phase ends, a 1.0.0 version will be cut, and
https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] is likely to be enforced.

Before reaching the stable phase, the client will use a versioning scheme of `[0.MINOR.PATCH]` where:

* `0` indicates the project is still in a stabilization phase.
* `MINOR` is a 0-based number incrementing with each new release cycle. It generally reflects significant changes like new features and potentially some programming interfaces changes.
* `PATCH` is a 0-based number incrementing with each service release, that is bux fixes.

Breaking changes between releases can happen but will be kept to a minimum.

== Build Instructions

You need JDK 11 or later installed.

To build the JAR file:
